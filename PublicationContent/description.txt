[h1]üìã Description[/h1]
Small server-side mutator that changes the lifespan of thrown weapons and dosh.

[h1]‚ùå Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP earned will not be saved.

But I hope that it will be whitelisted - I submitted whitelist request here:

[h1]üéÆ Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator.
[*]Create a file [b](*)[/b]: [code]C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Config\KFDPL.ini[/code]
with content:
[code][DPL.DPL]
Version=0[/code]
[*]Launch KF2.
[*]Open console (~) and start any map with the mutator (this will generate the default KFDPL.ini content):
[code]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=DPL.Mut[/code]
[*]Close the game and configure the mutator (see [b]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFDPL.ini)[/b] below).
[*]Launch KF2 again, open the console, and start the game:
[code]open KF-BioticsLab?Game=KFGameContent.KFGameInfo_Survival?Difficulty=3?GameLength=2?Mutator=DPL.Mut[/code]
(replace the map and set/add parameters you need).

[h1]üñ•Ô∏è Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If this is unclear, first read: [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server Guide (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url][/i]
[olist]
[*]Open [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b].
[*]Find [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and ensure line exists (add if missing):
[code]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/code]
(If there are several [b]DownloadManagers[/b] then the line above should be the first)
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[code]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2864944858[/code]
[*]Start server and wait for mutator download.
[*]When the download is complete, stop the server.
[*]Create a file [b](*)[/b]: [code]<kf2-server>\KFGame\Config\KFDPL.ini[/code]
with content:
[code][DPL.DPL]
Version=0[/code]
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [code]?Mutator=DPL.Mut[/code] and start the server (this will generate the default KFDPL.ini content).
[*]Stop the server and configure the mutator (see [b]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFDPL.ini)[/b] below).
[*]Start the server.
[/olist]

[h1]üêû (*) Buggy config initialization[/h1]
This mutator (like many others) relies on UnrealScript's default values (0 for int type) to detect first-time use and generate a config.
However, the game contains a bug that initializes unset values to random data, which can lead to incorrect settings or missing configs.

As a workaround, I recommend explicitly setting [b]Version=0[/b] in the config during the first initialization.

Unfortunately, I can't fix this issue because it's a game engine problem (not the mutator's fault).

[h1]‚öôÔ∏è Setup (KFDPL.ini)[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Weap[/b] - Time in seconds after which weapon disappears. If zero or less the default value is used.
[*][b]Dosh[/b] - Time in seconds after which dosh disappears. If zero or less the default value is used.
[/list]

[h1]üìå Notes[/h1]
[list]
[*]A large number of objects on the map can cause lags.
Some unscrupulous players may exploit this to harm your server: for example, they can throw a lot of money or weapons in a place inaccessible to other players (for example, in the pool on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1210703659]KF-KillingPool[/url]).
So do not use too large values when you configure the mutator.
[*]Unfortunately there is no way to change ammo lifespan for technical reasons (the CheckRelevance() function is never called on Projectile objects). Ammo will disappear within 1-3 minutes depending on the type of projectile.

[h1]‚òëÔ∏è Status: Completed[/h1]
‚úîÔ∏è The mutator works with the current version of the game (v1150) and I have implemented everything I planned.
‚õîÔ∏è Development has stopped: I no longer have the time or motivation to maintain this mod. No further updates or bug fixes are planned.
