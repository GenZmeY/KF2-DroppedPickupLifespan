[h1]Description[/h1]
Small server-side mutator that changes the lifespan of thrown weapons and dosh.

[h1]Whitelisted?[/h1]
[b]No.[/b] But I really hope that it will be whitelisted.

[b]‚ö†Ô∏è I submitted whitelist request here:[/b]

[h1]Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator;
[*]Start KF2; 
[*]Open console (~) and input:
[b]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=DPL.DPLMut[/b]
(replace the map and add the parameters you need)
[*]<Enter>.
[/olist]
[h1]Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If you don't understand what is written here, read the article [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url] before following these instructions.[/i]
[olist]
[*]Open your [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b];
[*]Find the [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and make sure that there is a line (add if not):
[b]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/b]
‚ùóÔ∏è If there are several [b]DownloadManagers=[/b] then the line above should be the first ‚ùóÔ∏è
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[b]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2864944858[/b]
[*]Start the server and wait while the mutator is downloading;
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [b]?Mutator=DPL.DPLMut[/b] and restart the server.
[/olist]

[h1]Important setup information[/h1]
The config should be created on first start, but now the game contains a bug that initializes the config values ‚Äã‚Äãrandomly if they are not explicitly set. Thus, the config may have incorrect values ‚Äã‚Äãor not be created at all.
So if you are using this mutator for the first time, I highly recommend doing the following:
[olist]
[*]Create (modify) [b]KFDPL.ini[/b] manually. Put the following content there:
[b][DPL.DPL]
Version=0[/b]
[*]Start the game/server with DPL to generate the contents of the config
[*]Close the game/server
[/olist]
[b]Right now this is the only way to correctly create the default config.[/b]
Unfortunately I can't do anything about it because it's a game problem (not mutator). I hope TWI fixes this someday.

[h1]Setup (KFDPL.ini)[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Weap[/b] - time in seconds after which weapon disappears. If zero or less the default value is used.
[*][b]Dosh[/b] - time in seconds after which dosh disappears. If zero or less the default value is used.
[/list]

‚ùóÔ∏è Note that a large number of objects on the map can cause lags.
Some unscrupulous players can use this to harm your server: for example, they can throw a lot of money or weapons in a place inaccessible to other players (for example, in the pool on [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1210703659]KF-KillingPool[/url]).
So do not use too large values when you configure the mutator.

[h1]Notes[/h1]
üìå Unfortunately there is no way to change ammo lifespan for technical reasons (the CheckRelevance() function is never called on Projectile objects). Ammo will disappear within 1-3 minutes depending on the type of projectile..
