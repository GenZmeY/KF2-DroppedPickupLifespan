[h1]Description[/h1]
Small server-side mutator that changes the lifespan of dropped weapons and dosh.

[h1]Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will de-rank your server. Any XP gained will not be saved.

[h1]Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator;
[*]Start KF2; 
[*]Open console (`) and input:
[b]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=DPL.DPLMut[/b]
(replace the map and add the parameters you need)
[*]<Enter>.
[/olist]
[h1]Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If you don't understand what is written here, read the article [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url] before following these instructions.[/i]
[olist]
[*]Open your [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b];
[*]Find the [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and make sure that there is a line (add if not):
[b]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/b]
‚ùóÔ∏è If there are several [b]DownloadManagers=[/b] then the line above should be the first ‚ùóÔ∏è
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[b]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2864944858[/b]
[*]Start the server and wait while the mutator is downloading;
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [b]?Mutator=DPL.DPLMut[/b] and restart the server.
[/olist]

[h1]Setup (KFDPL.ini)[/h1]
Config will be created at the first start[b]*[/b].
[list]
[*][b]Weap[/b] - time in seconds after which weapon disappears. If zero or less the default value is used.
[*][b]Dosh[/b] - time in seconds after which dosh disappears. If zero or less the default value is used.
[/list]

Do not use too large values because a large number of objects on the map can cause lags.

[h1]Notes[/h1]
üìå Unfortunately there is no way to change ammo lifespan for technical reasons (the CheckRelevance() function is never called on Projectile objects). Ammo will disappear within a minute.

[h1]Troubleshooting[/h1]
[b](*)[/b] If your config is not created for some reason, create it manually with the following content:
[b][DPL.DPL]
Version=0
[/b]

Then start the server and check the file again - config content should be generated.
